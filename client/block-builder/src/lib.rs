//! Substrate block builder
//!
//! This crate provides the [`BlockBuilder`] utility and the corresponding runtime api
//! [`BlockBuilder`](sp_block_builder::BlockBuilder).
//!
//! The block builder utility is used in the node as an abstraction over the runtime api to
//! initialize a block, to push extrinsics and to finalize a block.
